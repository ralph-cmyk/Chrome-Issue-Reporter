## üìä Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Implement Soon)
1. **Dark Mode**: Users increasingly expect dark mode
2. **Screenshot Capture**: Visual context is very valuable for issues
3. **Issue Templates**: Saves time and ensures consistency
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power users will love this

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Toast Notifications**: Better than status messages
2. **Draft Issues**: Prevent accidental loss of work
3. **Caching**: Improves performance significantly
4. **Multiple Repositories**: Common use case

### Low Priority (Future Consideration)
1. **Mobile App**: Different audience
2. **Webhook Support**: Advanced feature
3. **API Playground**: Developer-focused
4. **Analytics**: Nice but not essential

## üîß Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- Consider adding TypeScript for better type safety
- Add unit tests for critical functions
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Add JSDoc comments for better documentation

### Build Process
- Consider using a bundler (webpack, rollup) for better optimization
- Add minification for production builds
- Implement source maps for debugging
- Add automated testing in CI/CD

### Documentation
- Add inline code documentation
- Create a developer guide
- Document the OAuth flow in detail
- Add troubleshooting guide

## üé® Design System

Consider creating a formal design system:
- Document color palette and usage
- Define typography scale
- Standardize spacing units
- Create reusable component library
- Document animation standards

## üêõ Known Issues & Edge Cases

1. **Large Context**: Very large HTML snippets might hit API limits
2. **Rate Limiting**: Multiple rapid submissions could hit rate limits
3. **Token Expiry**: No automatic refresh of expired tokens
4. **Network Errors**: Limited retry logic for network failures
5. **Cross-Origin**: Some pages might block content script injection

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure success:
- Issue creation success rate
- Average time to create an issue
- User retention rate
- Context capture success rate
- OAuth flow completion rate
- User feedback scores

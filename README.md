# Chrome Issue Reporter

A Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that captures the current page context and helps you file GitHub
issues without leaving the browser. The extension uses the PKCE OAuth flow with
`chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow`, stores tokens securely in `chrome.storage.sync`, and submits
issues via the GitHub REST API.

## üöÄ Quick Installation

**Want to install this extension? It's easy!**

1. **Download:** Get the latest `chrome-issue-reporter.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/ralph-cmyk/Chrome-Issue-Reporter/releases) or [build it yourself](#building-from-source)
2. **Extract:** Unzip to a permanent location on your computer
3. **Install:** Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode, click "Load unpacked", and select the extracted folder

üìñ **For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**

## How It Works

   - Nearby script content
3. Review and edit the captured context in the popup
4. Submit directly to GitHub - the issue is created instantly
5. Get a link to your newly created issue

## Configuration

After installation, you need to configure the extension:

1. **Sign in with GitHub:**
   - Open the extension's **Options** page
   - Click **"Sign in with GitHub"** to start the Device Flow
   - You'll receive a code to enter on GitHub.com
   - After authorization, you're ready to go!

2. **Select a Repository:**
   - After signing in, click **"Load My Repositories"**
   - Choose the repository where you want to create issues from the dropdown
   - Or manually enter the repository owner and name

3. **Start Using:**
   - Right-click on any page and select **"Create GitHub Issue from Page/Selection"**
   - Review and submit your issue!

üìñ **See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed setup instructions**

> **Note:** This extension uses GitHub's Device Flow for authentication - no OAuth app setup required! 
> You can also use a Personal Access Token if you prefer.

## Using the extension

1. **Sign in with GitHub:** Open the extension's **Options** page and click **"Sign in with GitHub"**. 
   You'll get a code to enter on GitHub.com to authorize the extension. This uses GitHub's Device Flow - 
   no OAuth app creation needed!
2. **Select a repository:** After signing in, click **"Load My Repositories"** to see all repositories 
   you have access to. Choose one from the dropdown or manually enter the owner/repo. You can also set 
   default labels to apply to all issues.
3. When you encounter a problem on a web page, right-click and choose **Create GitHub Issue from
   Page/Selection**. The extension captures the current URL, selected text, surrounding HTML, nearby
   script content, and the most recent JavaScript error (if one was recorded).
4. The browser action popup shows the captured context, lets you edit the issue title and body, and
   submit the issue directly to GitHub. After submission the popup links to the newly created issue.

> **Alternative:** You can also sign in using a Personal Access Token instead of the Device Flow. 
> Create one at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `repo` scope 
> and enter it in the Options page.

## Permissions and privacy

- `contextMenus` ‚Äì adds the ‚ÄúCreate GitHub Issue from Page/Selection‚Äù menu item.
- `activeTab` and `scripting` ‚Äì used to communicate with the active tab and collect context.
- `storage` ‚Äì stores OAuth tokens, repository defaults, and captured context.
- Host permission `https://api.github.com/*` ‚Äì required to create issues via the GitHub API.

Captured page context (URL, selection, snippets, and last error message) is stored locally until you
submit or clear it. OAuth tokens are only stored inside Chrome‚Äôs managed storage. No data is sent to
third-party services other than GitHub APIs during authentication and issue creation.

## Building from Source

Want to build the extension yourself or contribute? Here's how:

### Quick Build
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ralph-cmyk/Chrome-Issue-Reporter.git
cd Chrome-Issue-Reporter

# Build and package
npm run package
```

This creates `chrome-issue-reporter.zip` ready for distribution or installation.

### Available Scripts
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts
- `npm run build` - Build extension to `dist/` folder
- `npm run package` - Build and create ZIP file

### Manual Build
If you don't have Node.js:
```bash
cd extension
zip -r ../chrome-issue-reporter.zip *
```

## For Developers

### Development Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension/` directory

### Testing Changes
After making changes:
1. Save your files
2. Click the Reload button for the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

## Troubleshooting

- **Rate limits:** If GitHub responds with a 403 and `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`, the extension will
  surface a rate-limit message. Wait until the limit resets or adjust your usage.
- **Expired tokens:** A 401 response clears the stored token and prompts you to sign in again.
- **Context capture issues:** Use the context menu again to refresh the captured data or click
  **Clear** in the popup before retrying.
